# How the Python Minecraft Ping Server Code Works ⚙️🔬

This document explains the Python code (`server.py`) that acts like a very basic Minecraft Bedrock server, just enough to show up in the server list. Think of it as a detailed tour of the friendly robot's blueprints and internal wiring! 🤖🔧

**The Big Picture: What's the Goal? 🎯**

The code sets up a listener 👂 on your computer. This listener waits patiently for a specific type of network message (an "Unconnected Ping" 핑퐁) that the Minecraft game sends out when it's looking for servers on your network.

When our listener hears this "ping," it springs into action! It carefully builds a special reply message (an "Unconnected Pong" <0xF0><0x9F><0x8E><0x93>) containing server details (like its name, player count, version). Then, it sends this "pong" message back to the Minecraft game. The game reads the details and displays our server in your server list! ✅

**Let's Break Down the Code Section by Section:**

### 1. Importing the Toolboxes 🧰 (`import ...`)

```python
import socket  # Network communication tools (like a walkie-talkie 📻)
import time    # Time-related tools (like a stopwatch ⏱️)
import struct  # Packing/unpacking data into specific byte formats (a secret decoder ring 💍 for computer messages!)
import random  # Generating random numbers (like rolling dice 🎲)
from threading import Thread # Running tasks simultaneously (letting the robot listen while doing other things! 👯)
```

*   We start by bringing in pre-written code libraries ("toolboxes") that give our script special powers.
*   `socket`: Absolutely essential for sending and receiving messages over the network (using the UDP protocol in this case).
*   `time`: Used for `time.sleep(1)` to let the main part of the robot rest instead of spinning in circles uselessly.
*   `struct`: Super important! It converts Python data (like numbers) into the *exact* sequence of raw bytes  Bytes that Minecraft expects, and reads incoming bytes back into Python data.
*   `random`: Used to give our server a unique ID number (`server_guid`).
*   `Thread`: Allows the listening part (`listen` function) to run in the background, so the main program doesn't get stuck waiting.

### 2. The Server Blueprint 🏗️ (`class MinecraftBedrockServer:`)

```python
class MinecraftBedrockServer:
    # ... all the robot's instructions and parts go here ...
```

*   A `class` is like a detailed blueprint for creating something. Here, it's the blueprint for our "Minecraft Server Robot". All the logic, data, and actions related to the server are neatly organized inside this blueprint.

### 3. Setting Up the Robot: Construction Time! 🛠️ (`__init__`)

```python
    def __init__(self, host='0.0.0.0', port=19132):
        self.host = host          # Robot's street address (where to listen) 🏠
        self.port = port          # Robot's specific door number 🚪 (19132 is common for MC)
        self.socket = None        # Walkie-talkie is off initially 🔌
        self.running = False      # Power switch is off initially 🚫
        self.server_guid = random.randint(0, 2**64 - 1) # Assign a unique secret ID ✨
        self.motd = { ... }       # The message board (dictionary) holding server info 📝
```

*   The `__init__` method (short for "initialize") is the constructor. It runs automatically *every time* we build a new robot using the `MinecraftBedrockServer` blueprint.
*   `self`: A special variable representing the *specific* robot instance being built right now.
*   `host='0.0.0.0'`: The network address. `0.0.0.0` is special, meaning "listen on *all* network connections this computer has" (like listening at every window of the house).
*   `port=19132`: The UDP port number. Think of it as the specific door Minecraft knows to knock on.
*   `self.socket = None`: The network connection (walkie-talkie) isn't set up yet.
*   `self.running = False`: A flag to track if the server should be active. Starts as OFF.
*   `self.server_guid = ...`: Gives the server a unique 64-bit random number ID, which RakNet uses.
*   `self.motd = {...}`: Creates a Python `dictionary` (like a labeled list or message board) to store the server's details (name, version, player count etc.) that will be shown in the game list.

### 4. Turning the Robot ON: Power Up! ⚡ (`start`)

```python
    def start(self):
        # Prepare the walkie-talkie (socket)
        self.socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
        # Tell it which address and door number to use
        self.socket.bind((self.host, self.port))
        # Flip the main power switch ON
        self.running = True
        print(f"✅ Server Power ON! Listening at {self.host}:{self.port}")

        # Create and start the helper 'listen' thread
        listen_thread = Thread(target=self.listen)
        listen_thread.daemon = True # Helper stops if main robot stops
        listen_thread.start()       # Go, helper, go! ▶️

        # Main robot waits patiently...
        try:
            while self.running:
                time.sleep(1) # Zzz... wait a second
        except KeyboardInterrupt: # If someone presses Ctrl+C...
            self.stop()           # ...initiate shutdown sequence!
```

*   Gets the `socket` ready: Specifies Internet addressing (`AF_INET`) and UDP (`SOCK_DGRAM` - connectionless, like sending postcards 📮).
*   `self.socket.bind(...)`: Claims the specified address and port. Now it's actively listening at that "door".
*   Sets `self.running = True`. The robot is officially ON!
*   Prints a happy startup message.
*   **Threading Magic!** ✨ Creates a separate "helper" (`Thread`) to run the `self.listen` function. This is key! The helper handles *all* the waiting for messages, freeing up the main robot.
    *   `daemon = True`: Links the helper's fate to the main robot. If the main program exits, the helper exits too.
    *   `listen_thread.start()`: Tells the helper to start its `listen` job.
*   The `while self.running:` loop keeps the main thread alive (but mostly resting via `time.sleep`) until `Ctrl+C` is pressed or `self.running` becomes `False`.
*   `except KeyboardInterrupt`: Catches `Ctrl+C` and calls `self.stop()` for a clean shutdown.

### 5. Turning the Robot OFF: Power Down Sequence 🔌 (`stop`)

```python
    def stop(self):
        self.running = False  # Flip the main power switch OFF 🚫
        if self.socket:
            self.socket.close() # Turn off the walkie-talkie 📻➡️⏹️
        print("⛔ Server Power OFF.")
```

*   Sets `self.running = False`, signaling all loops (in `start` and `listen`) to stop.
*   `self.socket.close()`: Politely closes the network connection, releasing the port.
*   Prints a shutdown message.

### 6. The Robot's Ear: Listening for Knocks 👂 (`listen`)

```python
    def listen(self):
        # This runs in the separate 'helper' thread!
        while self.running: # Keep listening while the power is ON
            try:
                # Wait here until a message arrives... 📥
                data, addr = self.socket.recvfrom(1024)
                # Got one! Give it to the brain to handle 🧠
                self.handle_packet(data, addr)
            except socket.error:
                # Uh oh, walkie-talkie problem? Stop listening. 💥
                break
```

*   This function is the helper thread's entire job.
*   `while self.running:`: The core loop – keeps running as long as the server should be ON.
*   `self.socket.recvfrom(1024)`: **The crucial listening point!** This line *pauses* the helper thread until a UDP message arrives on the `socket`. It accepts messages up to 1024 bytes.
    *   `data`: The raw message content (bytes).
    *   `addr`: The sender's IP address and port (who sent the message).
*   `self.handle_packet(data, addr)`: Sends the received message (`data`) and sender info (`addr`) to the main processing function.
*   `except socket.error`: If `recvfrom` fails (e.g., the socket is closed by `stop`), the loop terminates gracefully.

### 7. The Robot's Brain: Processing the Mail 🧠 (`handle_packet`)

```python
    def handle_packet(self, data, addr):
        if not data: # Ignore empty messages
            return

        # Helpful debugging prints to see what arrived 📄
        print("===== Received a Packet =====")
        print(f" - From MC Client: {addr}")
        print(f" - Packet Bytes (hex): {data.hex()}")

        # What kind of message is this? Check the first byte (Packet ID)! 🤔
        packet_id = data[0]
        if packet_id == 0x01: # 0x01 = Unconnected Ping (Minecraft asking "Are you there?")
             print("➡️ It's an Unconnected Ping! Handling...")
             self.handle_unconnected_ping(data, addr)
        # else:
             # print(f"❓ Received unknown packet type: {hex(packet_id)}")
             # In a REAL server, we'd handle many other IDs:
             # 0x05: Open Connection Request 1
             # 0x07: Open Connection Request 2
             # 0x09: Connection Request
             # 0x80-0x8f: Game packets (Login, Move, Chat...) etc.
             pass # We only care about Pings for this simple example!
```

*   This function acts as the central dispatcher, deciding what to do based on the message type.
*   It first ignores empty messages.
*   Includes `print` statements to show incoming packet details (very useful for debugging!).
*   **Packet ID Check:** The most important part! It examines the *very first byte* (`data[0]`) of the message. In the RakNet protocol (which Minecraft Bedrock uses), this byte tells us the message type.
    *   `if data[0] == 0x01:`: Checks if the ID is `0x01`. This specific ID means it's an "Unconnected Ping" request – the game asking for server info for the list.
    *   If it *is* a ping, it calls the dedicated function `self.handle_unconnected_ping`.
    *   If it's *not* `0x01`, this simple script ignores it (`pass`). A real game server would have many more `elif data[0] == ...:` checks to handle login, gameplay packets, etc.

### 8. Answering "Hello?" - Crafting the Reply 📢 (`handle_unconnected_ping`)

```python
    def handle_unconnected_ping(self, data, addr):
        # Basic checks: Is the ping message long enough? (Needs at least 33 bytes)
        if len(data) < 33: return # Too short, likely invalid.

        # --- Use the 'struct' decoder ring to read the ping data ---
        # Read bytes 1-8 as the Time sent by the client (Big Endian unsigned 64-bit int)
        ping_time = struct.unpack('>Q', data[1:9])[0]
        # Read bytes 9-24 as the 'Magic' bytes (a fixed RakNet identifier)
        magic = data[9:25]
        # Read bytes 25-32 as the Client's GUID (another Big Endian unsigned 64-bit int)
        client_guid = struct.unpack('>Q', data[25:33])[0]
        # ---------------------------------------------------------

        # Verification: Does it have the correct RakNet magic sequence? 🕵️
        expected_magic = b'\x00\xff\xff\x00\xfe\xfe\xfe\xfe\xfd\xfd\xfd\xfd\x12\x34\x56\x78'
        if magic != expected_magic:
            print("❌ Invalid magic bytes! Ignoring packet.")
            return

        # --- Construct the MOTD String ---
        # The order and format here are VERY specific and REQUIRED by Minecraft!
        motd_parts = [
            'MCPE',                      # Required header
            self.motd['motd1'],          # Server name line 1
            self.motd['protocol_version'],# Protocol number (e.g., '786')
            self.motd['game_version'],   # Game version string (e.g., '1.21.73')
            str(self.motd['current_players']), # Current players (as text)
            str(self.motd['max_players']),     # Max players (as text)
            str(self.server_guid),       # Our server's unique ID (as text)
            self.motd['motd2'],          # Server name line 2
            self.motd['game_mode'],      # Game mode (e.g., 'Survival')
            '1',                         # Numeric Game mode (1=Survival, 0=Creative, etc.)
            '19132',                     # IPv4 Port (usually same as listening port)
            '19133',                     # IPv6 Port (often ignored, but needed)
        ]
        motd_data = ';'.join(motd_parts) # Join parts with semicolons!
        # --------------------------------

        # --- Build the Pong Packet (the reply message) byte-by-byte ---
        pong_packet = bytearray()        # Start with an empty byte container

        # 1. Packet ID (0x1c = Unconnected Pong)
        pong_packet.append(0x1c)
        # 2. Client's Ping Time (send it back)
        pong_packet.extend(struct.pack('>Q', ping_time))
        # 3. Our Server GUID
        pong_packet.extend(struct.pack('>Q', self.server_guid))
        # 4. RakNet Magic Bytes (send them back)
        pong_packet.extend(magic)
        # 5. Length of the MOTD string (as a 16-bit unsigned int)
        pong_packet.extend(struct.pack('>H', len(motd_data)))
        # 6. The MOTD string itself (encoded as UTF-8 bytes)
        pong_packet.extend(motd_data.encode('utf-8'))
        # ---------------------------------------------------------

        # Send the completed Pong packet back to the client! 📤
        self.socket.sendto(pong_packet, addr)
        print(f"✅ Sent Pong response to {addr}")
        # print(f"   MOTD data: {motd_data}") # Uncomment to see the exact MOTD string
```

*   This function is the heart of the server's *response* logic.
*   **Decoding the Ping (`struct.unpack`):** It uses `struct.unpack` with format codes (`>Q` for Big-Endian 64-bit unsigned integer) to pull specific pieces of data (ping time, magic bytes, client ID) out of the raw byte message (`data`) received from the client.
*   **Verification:** It checks if the extracted `magic` bytes match the known RakNet sequence. This is a basic sanity check.
*   **Building the MOTD String:** It carefully creates the string that contains all the server info. This string *must* follow a strict format, using semicolons (`;`) as separators between specific fields in a specific order. Minecraft relies on this order to parse the info correctly.
*   **Encoding the Pong (`struct.pack`):** This is the reverse of unpacking. It takes Python data (like numbers `ping_time`, `self.server_guid`, `len(motd_data)`) and uses `struct.pack` with format codes (`>Q`, `>H`) to convert them into the precise sequence of bytes needed for the reply packet. It also appends the Pong Packet ID (`0x1c`), the magic bytes, and the encoded MOTD string.
*   **Sending the Reply:** `self.socket.sendto(pong_packet, addr)` transmits the fully assembled `pong_packet` back to the original sender (`addr`).

### 9. Changing the Welcome Sign: Quick Edits! ✏️ (`set_motd`)

```python
    def set_motd(self, motd1=None, motd2=None, ...):
        # Update parts of the self.motd dictionary if new values are given
        if motd1: self.motd['motd1'] = motd1
        if motd2: self.motd['motd2'] = motd2
        # ... and so on for game_mode, max_players, etc. ...
```

*   A simple helper function. It allows you to easily update the server details stored in the `self.motd` dictionary *before* the server starts. It checks if a new value was provided for each field and updates the dictionary accordingly.

### 10. Running the Show: Let's Go! ▶️ (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

```python
# This block only runs when you execute this script directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("🚀 Preparing the server robot...")
    # Build the robot using the blueprint
    server = MinecraftBedrockServer(port=19132)

    # Optional: Customize the server sign before starting
    print("🎨 Customizing the server sign (MOTD)...")
    server.set_motd(
        motd1="§bPython §eRakNet §aServer",
        motd2="§dSimple MOTD Example",
        # ... other settings ...
    )

    # Try to start the server and keep it running
    try:
        server.start() # Initiate the startup sequence!
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # User pressed Ctrl+C, time to shut down
        print("\n🚦 Ctrl+C detected! Initiating shutdown...")
        server.stop()
    print("👋 Robot has finished its job.")
```

*   This standard Python construct `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures the code inside it only runs when you execute `python server.py` directly (and not if you were to `import server` into another Python file).
*   `server = MinecraftBedrockServer(...)`: Creates an actual "robot" object from our blueprint.
*   `server.set_motd(...)`: Calls the helper function to apply any desired customizations to the MOTD *before* starting.
*   `server.start()`: Kicks off the whole process – turns the robot ON!
*   The `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` block allows for a clean shutdown using `Ctrl+C`. It catches the interrupt signal and calls `server.stop()`.
